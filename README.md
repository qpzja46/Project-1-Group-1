# The Relationship Between Crime and Temperature in the U.S. 

Hypothesis: If a cityâ€™s temperature fluctuates  throughout the year, then there is more variance for crimes committed from season to season

Project Overview
-----
1. Determine whether crime is affected by temperature
2. Explored 3 cities that are geographically dispersed with contrasting temperature
3. Utilized two data sets: 
   2018 temperature data from Google & Crime Data from Data.gov
4. Organized, processed, and analyzed data using Python Jupyter Notebook and various libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc) to create graphs
5. Leveraged Google Maps API to create heatmaps for visualization

In this repo you will find the following information:
-----
"Crime_Data" contains all our crime data referenced in our code.

"Pictures" contains all of our final png files exported from our code.
Additionally, there are screenshots of our Heatmaps that were used
in the PowerPoint presentation.

"Weather_Data" contains the weather data referenced in the code.

The following files are the final versions of our code and their corresponding config files used to create the Heatmaps:
------
AustinCrime&WeatherCode.ipynb
configMP

JayCodevMP.ipynb
configJJ.py

LisaCodeVM.ipynb
Config.py

"Old Resources" contains folders that contain earlier versions of code, 
unused pictures from old versions of our code, and unused data files 
from old iterations of our project.
